## About <a name = "about"></a>

üìñ [Hugo in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/hugo-in-action) teaches you to build and host your own fully customizable static website with the Hugo engine.

> A basic website for a company named Acme Corporation. Acme Corporation is a leading manufacturer of shapes like lines, circles, squares and triangle in digital form in the planet. We will be using an existing Hugo theme and start with understanding how to add content to a Hugo website.

Hugo skeleton generated by the hugo new command:

``` bash
‚ùØ tree -C
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CONTRIBUTING.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ archetypes
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ default.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ themes

6 directories, 4 files
```

The various parts of a Hugo website consist of:

- the `archetypes` folder for the content templates,
- the `config` file for the settings and metadata,
- the `content` for the textual content,
- the `data` for structured content (key value pairs),
- the `layouts` and `themes` for the template and design of individual pages and
- the `static` folder for additional content that needs to be hosted but does not fit into any other category.

### Prerequisites

- git
- GitHub Account

### Installing

``` bash
# Install Hugo
brew install hugo

# Install Tree
brew install tree
```

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

``` bash
# Create a site skeleton with yaml.
hugo new site acme-corporation --format yaml

# Create an empty GitHub repository.
git init .

# Add files that were just created using the Hugo command line.
git add --all

# Check-in those files to version control with a commit message.
git commit -m "Create website skeleton"

# Add origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/russomi-labs/acme-corporation.git

# Move the current branch to "main" -M Shortcut for --move --force.
git branch -M main

# git push adding upstream tracking branch at origin main.
git push -u origin main
```

### Migrating to Hugo

Hugo supports importing content from Jekyll and automatically converts content from the Jekyll format to the format that Hugo understands.

You can use `hugo import jekyll <source jekyll folder> <target hugo folder>` command to import content from Jekyll into a Hugo website.

This command does not provide synchronization and is meant for a one time import.

### Adding a theme

There multiple ways to get a theme:

1. Use Hugo Modules to integrate the theme
2. Use git sub-modules to have a reference to the theme in the themes folder
3. Download and copy the theme to the themes folder

Configure the theme in `config.yaml` :

``` yaml
baseURL: http://example.org/
languageCode: en-us
title: My New Hugo Site
theme: Eclectic
```

This tells Hugo to look for a folder named `Eclectic` in the `themes` folder and load the theme from that folder.

### Running the dev server

You can run our Acme website in development mode using the command `hugo server` .

This hosts the hugo based website locally (at <http://localhost:1313/>) and automatically rebuilds it as the content changes and the changes we do in the theme as well as in the content update in near realtime in the browser.

``` bash
# Run the development server locally
hugo server
```

## Adding content

### Configuration

- [config.yaml](config.yaml) - These changes provide the information to fill up the menus, the footer, copyright notices as well as the title and author information as per the requirements of the theme eclectic for Acme Corporation.

### Content Pages

- Content pages can be created as text/markup files in the content folder.

### Index Page

- The index page, also called the home or the landing page is a special page in most websites whose content is unique and different from all other pages.
- Hugo provides a special template for the index page called the index template.

> We can override templates in a Hugo theme by placing a html template file in the layouts folder. Doing that provides someone who understands HTML a quick way to customize a website without learning Hugo. The custom HTML can be very specific to a particular website but until we use Hugo's template language, we have to be very careful with the HTML we are writing as the custom HTMl page does not change automatically when the content it links to changes. - [Hugo in Action - Chapter 2](https://livebook.manning.com/book/hugo-in-action/chapter-2/v-7/point-9294-88-88-0)

## Continuous Delivery

The simplicity of Netlify and GitHub Pages is best approach to get started with learning Hugo.
